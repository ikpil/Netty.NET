/**
 * <p>A promise combiner monitors the outcome of a number of discrete futures, then notifies a final, aggregate promise
 * when all of the combined futures are finished. The aggregate promise will succeed if and only if all of the combined
 * futures succeed. If any of the combined futures fail, the aggregate promise will fail. The cause failure for the
 * aggregate promise will be the failure for one of the failed combined futures; if more than one of the combined
 * futures fails, exactly which cause of failure will be assigned to the aggregate promise is undefined.</p>
 *
 * <p>Callers may populate a promise combiner with any number of futures to be combined via the
 * {@link PromiseCombiner#add(Future)} and {@link PromiseCombiner#addAll(Future[])} methods. When all futures to be
 * combined have been added, callers must provide an aggregate promise to be notified when all combined promises have
 * finished via the {@link PromiseCombiner#finish(Promise)} method.</p>
 *
 * <p>This implementation is <strong>NOT</strong> thread-safe and all methods must be called
 * from the {@link IEventExecutor} thread.</p>
